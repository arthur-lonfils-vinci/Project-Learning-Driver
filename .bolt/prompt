For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.

This project is working with two separate directories one for all the frontend content ("./frontend") and one for all the backend content and database ("./backend").
You have to respect this schema when updating/correcting the code.

Before using command requiring to be in a specifique directory (example: "cd ../frontend"), either be sure to know where you are in the directories or ask me to go in specific directory.

When coding or implementing functionnalities, don't hesisate to ask me question about it, then you will update/correct the code within the project.
